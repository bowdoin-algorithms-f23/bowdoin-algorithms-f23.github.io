## Welcome to Algorithms, Fall 2023! 

This Github site hosts the syllabus and all **public** resources for the class, such as lecture notes, policies, etc.  In addition we'll use: 

* __Canvas__: The class  has  a _Canvas_ site, accessible through your Bowdoin portal, that hosts the **private** resources for this class (quizzes, programming assignments, recordings if any). 

* __Gradescope__:  You'll use Gradescope for the assignments. Gradescope helps streamline the process of submission, grading and returning feedback, and it is also useful for implementing practices like anonymous grading.

* __Slack__: Class communication will be entirely on Slack. You will need to monitor Slack for class updates, including possible cancellations or delays. 

Instructions on how to join Gradescope/Slack are posted on the Canvas site for this class.
