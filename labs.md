### Labs 

Every week we have a designated lab period in which you'll work on a
problem set focused on the topics discussed that week. The lab
problems are meant to be solved in class, during the designated lab
time, working with your group.  Myself and the LAs will be around to
work with the groups, facilitate discussions and answer questions.

Labs are __not__ graded. however it is important that you strive to
understand all problems as they are designed to extend the
lectures. __It is your responsibility to complete the lab problems and
get your questions answered__. We will ocasionally go over solutions
as a class and if you find that useful (or not) be sure to let me know
how you feel so that we can adjust.

Overall youâ€™ll probably find that most of your learning occurs
in the lab while working with your peers.
