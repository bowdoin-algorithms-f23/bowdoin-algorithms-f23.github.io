### Labs 

Every week we have a designated lab period in which you'll work on a
problem set focused on the topics discussed that week. The lab
problems are meant to be solved in class, during the designated lab
time, working with your group.  Myself and the LAs will be around to
work with the groups, facilitate discussions and answer questions.

Labs are __not__ graded and their goal is to help you learn. It is important that you strive to work through all problems,  check your notes, formulate questions, discuss with your group, the LAs and the instructor, and get your questions answered. We will ocasionally go over solutions to some lab problems as a class and if you find that useful (or not) be sure to let me know how you feel so that we can adjust.

Overall you will   find that most of your learning occurs in the lab.
