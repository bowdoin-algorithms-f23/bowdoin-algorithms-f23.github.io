### Assignments 


There will be 8-12 assignments this semester, roughly one assignment
per week, which  will be released
in Gradescope --- just watch Slack for the announcement.

The assignments consist of _new_ problems for which you'll have to
come up with efficient solutions on your own. The
assignments are not tests — they are not meant as a test—
they provide opportunities to learn.

We expect everyone to do well on the homework, and to take the time to
write your work carefully. An important goal of the
assignments is to develop good algorithmic writing style --- your
solutions need to look professional, neat, easy to understand,
explained, justified and analyzed.


__Partner optional:__  You may work with one partner (see course policies for details on what this means).   One member of the team should submit the assignment and should  add the other member to the "team" so that (s)he  can get the credit. 

__Honor code:__ Assignmentsare at collaboration-level 1; that is,
verbal collaboration without solution sharing (check course policies
for details on what this means).  There are lots of resources online,
such as lecture notes, animations, visualizations, practice problems,
video recordings, which you are encouraged to explore to help you
understand the material. __However, you must be careful not to search
the internet (and that includes ChatGPT) for specific problems with
the intent to get hints for their solutions. Searching for the
assignment problems on the internet violates academic honesty for this
class.__
